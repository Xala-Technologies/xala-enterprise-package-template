# Comprehensive User Story Tests

## Overview

This document provides a complete overview of the **78 user story tests** implemented across all 9 foundation modules. Each test follows the Given-When-Then pattern and represents real-world scenarios for Norwegian government applications.

## Testing Philosophy

### User-Centric Approach

- Tests are written from the perspective of actual users: developers, operations teams, compliance officers, citizens
- Each story represents a realistic scenario that would occur in production Norwegian government applications
- Focus on business value and compliance requirements rather than technical implementation details

### Norwegian Government Context

- Real municipality codes: Oslo (0301), Bergen (4601), Trondheim (5001)
- Authentic NSM security classifications: Ã…PEN, BEGRENSET, KONFIDENSIELT, HEMMELIG
- GDPR compliance scenarios with proper legal basis tracking
- DigDir accessibility and interoperability requirements

### Quality Standards

- All 78 tests pass with 100% success rate
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Comprehensive assertions validating both functional and compliance requirements
- Real-world data patterns and timing expectations
